This project replaces the LISS heliplot service. Currently all LISS heliplots are from LH data, a notch filter will be introduced for the higher frequency signals (i.e. 100, 40, 20 Hz). There are three main config files that are parsed: stationNames.txt (this gives all the station names pulled from aslres01), prestation.cfg (lists all station info from channelID to the type of filter being used on the signals), station.cfg (contains all pre data from prestation.cfg as well as all station names from stationNames.txt). Currently working on multiprocessing for the filters on each station stream.
